## Introduction

This repo contains a sample code to leverage crypto libraries in GoLang to create a REST API endpoint that will take data in plaintext and return a cryptographic equivalent.

This example is then extended to include calling Thales CipherTrust RESTFul Data Protection protect and reveal endpoints to simplify the data protection in any GoLang application.
